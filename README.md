### What I learned

In completing the Skilled Landing Page challenge for Frontend Mentor, I delved into various technologies and best practices, honing my skills in modern web development. I embraced Semantic HTML5 markup for enhanced accessibility and structure. The use of CSS custom properties, Flexbox, and CSS Grid empowered me to create a flexible and visually appealing layout.

Adopting a mobile-first workflow enabled me to develop a responsive design that seamlessly adapts to various screen sizes. Implementing responsive images was a crucial aspect of performance optimization. Through Art Direction, Density Switching, and Resolution Switching, I ensured an optimal user experience on devices with different screen resolutions and pixel densities.

Integrating React into the project not only provided a dynamic and efficient JavaScript library but also deepened my understanding of component-based architecture. Leveraging performance testing tools such as Lighthouse and PageSpeed Testing allowed me to fine-tune the site for optimal speed and efficiency.

This project provided valuable hands-on experience, reinforcing my knowledge of responsive design principles, performance optimization strategies, and the effective use of modern web technologies. Overall, it was a journey of growth and skill enhancement in frontend development.

## Responsive Image

```react
<picture className="hero-img">
        <source
          // srcset Attribute for Density switching based on DPR of the screen
          srcSet={`${heroDesk1x} 1x, ${heroDesk2x} 2x`}
          media="(min-width: 1280px)"
          width={992}
          height={937}
        />
        <source
          // srcset Attribute for Density switching based on DPR of the screen
          srcSet={`${heroTab1x} 1x, ${heroTab2x} 2x`}
          media="(min-width: 768px)"
          width={640}
          height={640}
        />

        <img
          // srcset Attribute for Density switching based on DPR of the screen
          srcSet={`${heroMobile1x} 1x, ${heroMobile2x} 2x`}
          // sizes attribute for resolution switching ( letting the browser decide which image to download based on the width of the image on screen)
          sizes="(max-width: 767px) 69vw, (min-width: 768px) 84vw, 88vw"
          src={heroMobile1x}
          alt="hero image"
          className="hero-img"
          width={327}
          height={301}
        />
      </picture>
```
